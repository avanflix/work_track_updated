# WorkTrack — Employee Work Tracking System

A production-grade employee task tracking system built with Next.js 16 (App
Router), TypeScript, MongoDB/Mongoose, NextAuth v5, TanStack Query, and
Tailwind + shadcn-style components.

This README documents what's included, what's intentionally deferred, and
how to run it.

## What's included

- **Email/password auth** (NextAuth v5, Credentials provider, JWT sessions,
  bcrypt hashing). Deactivated accounts are blocked at both the auth layer
  and the proxy/middleware layer with the exact message specified in the
  brief.
- **Role-based access control** for `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `EMPLOYEE`,
  centralized in `utils/permissions.ts` — a single permissions matrix, not
  scattered `if (role === ...)` checks, so it's easy to extend for future
  modules.
- **Route protection** via `proxy.ts` (Next 16's renamed middleware
  convention) plus per-route checks in every API handler (defense in depth).
- **Employee management**: Super Admin can create Admins/Employees,
  activate/deactivate, and delete. Admins can view but not manage.
- **Task management**: full lifecycle (Pending → In Progress → Completed /
  Delayed / Cancelled), priority, department, completion %, remarks, time
  tracking, and a append-only **timeline** of every update (the "10:00 AM
  Started task..." style trail from the spec).
- **Delay workflow**: employees submit a reason + new expected date once a
  deadline passes; Admin/Super Admin approve or reject.
- **Dashboards**: role-aware — Admin sees company-wide stats + charts
  (tasks by status, tasks per employee); Employee sees their own
  today/pending/completed/delayed counts and task list.
- **Notifications**: in-app, created on task assignment, task completion,
  and delay submission/review; polled client-side.
- **Search & filters**: employees (name/email/department) and tasks
  (search, status, priority).
- **Security**: Zod validation on every API input, bcrypt password hashing,
  a simple in-memory rate limiter on write endpoints (`lib/rateLimit.ts` —
  swap for Redis/Upstash behind a load balancer), and role checks on every
  route handler in addition to the proxy.
- **Architecture**: repository-pattern `services/` layer between routes and
  Mongoose models, `hooks/` wrapping TanStack Query, a centralized
  `lib/apiClient.ts`, and shared `types/`. New modules (attendance, leave,
  payroll, chat, CRM, etc.) plug in as new models + services + routes +
  dashboard cards without touching this core.

## What's deliberately not built

The brief's "Future Ready Architecture" section lists ~20 future modules
(attendance, payroll, chat, video calls, CRM, invoices, AI assistant, and
so on). Those are **explicitly future modules** in the spec, not part of
the current deliverable list — this build makes sure they *can* be added
without refactoring (clean service layer, RBAC matrix, notification system
already in place) rather than stubbing all of them out now.

A few smaller things to know about:
- Notifications are polled (30s), not pushed via websockets — swap in
  Pusher/Ably or a websocket server if you need real-time push.
- File attachments on tasks are marked "(Future)" in the brief itself and
  are not implemented.
- There's no email delivery (e.g. "deadline approaching" emails) — only
  in-app notifications. The brief specifies email *login*, not email
  *sending*.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

### 2. Install
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Fill in `MONGODB_URI`, a strong random `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (e.g.
`openssl rand -base64 32`), and the bootstrap Super Admin credentials.

### 4. Create the Super Admin
Nobody can create a Super Admin from the UI (Admins can't create Admins,
and there's no self-registration — by design, per the spec). Run the seed
script once against a fresh database:
```bash
npm run seed:super-admin
```

### 5. Run
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000`, sign in with the Super Admin credentials,
and start creating Admins/Employees from **Employees → Add employee / admin**.

### 6. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Messaging

- Any active user (Employee, Admin, Super Admin) can open a 1:1 chat with
  any other active user, regardless of role — go to **Messages → New chat**.
- Every active user is automatically a member of the single, auto-managed
  **Company Group** (no one needs to be invited; new hires are folded in
  the next time anyone opens the group).
- Chat is polling-based (TanStack Query, 5–15s intervals) via
  `/api/chat/*`, matching the existing Notifications pattern — there's no
  WebSocket server in this stack, so this is the low-complexity option
  that still feels close to real-time.
- **Oversight (read-only):** Super Admin can view every conversation in
  the workspace (all Employee + Admin chats). Admin can view every
  conversation that has at least one Employee participant. This lives
  under the **Team Chats** tab on the Messages page and is backed by
  `/api/chat/monitor`, which is intentionally read-only (no POST route) —
  monitoring is for oversight, not for posting as someone else.

## Meetings & Calls

- **1:1 calls** — click the phone/video icons in a direct chat (Messages)
  to ring that person immediately. They get an incoming-call prompt
  (Accept/Decline) wherever they are in the app, polled via
  `/api/calls/incoming`.
- **Meetings** — schedule ahead of time from **Meetings**: title, time,
  duration, and either an in-app call or an external link (Zoom/Meet/etc).
  Invitees get a notification and can join from the Upcoming list or the
  calendar view. The organizer can end an in-app meeting for everyone.
- **In-app calls are real WebRTC** (browser camera/mic, peer-to-peer
  audio/video), not screen-shares or embeds. Signaling (who's calling whom,
  SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates) is relayed through `/api/calls/*`
  via polling — consistent with the rest of the app's no-WebSocket-server
  design — so call setup takes a second or two rather than being instant.
  Group meeting calls use a mesh topology (every participant connects
  directly to every other), which is fine for small teams but doesn't
  scale to large meetings the way an SFU would.
- **TURN/NAT traversal:** STUN alone (what was originally configured)
  frequently fails to connect two peers on real-world networks — mobile
  data, most corporate/hotel Wi-Fi, and especially carrier-grade NAT. When
  that happens, signaling still succeeds (both sides "join") but no media
  ever flows, which looks like "my video shows, theirs never does." A
  free shared TURN fallback (Open Relay Project) is now baked into
  `hooks/useWebRTCCall.ts` so calls work out of the box across networks.
  Its credentials are public/shared by many apps though, so treat it as a
  "should mostly work" safety net rather than a production guarantee —
  for real reliability, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_URL` /
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_USERNAME` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_CREDENTIAL` in
  `.env.local` to your own TURN account (Metered.ca, Twilio, Cloudflare,
  or self-hosted coturn). If a peer still can't connect, the call room
  now shows it explicitly (per-tile "Couldn't connect" + a banner)
  instead of silently sitting blank, and one automatic ICE-restart retry
  is attempted first.

## WhatsApp Notifications

Every notification the app creates — task assigned, deadline approaching,
task completed/issue, delay submitted/reviewed, meeting scheduled/cancelled,
plus anything else routed through `notificationService.create()` — also
attempts a WhatsApp message to the recipient, in addition to the existing
in-app notification. It's additive: WhatsApp delivery failing (or not being
configured) never blocks the underlying action or the in-app notification.

**This needs your own Meta Business/WhatsApp Business setup — nothing here
can be tested or pre-configured without real credentials:**

1. Create a Meta App with the WhatsApp product in [Meta Business
   Manager](https://business.facebook.com), and get a phone number ID and a
   permanent access token (a System User token, not the 24h temporary one).
2. **Message templates:** WhatsApp requires Meta-approved templates for
   *business-initiated* messages (which is what task/notification pings
   are — the employee didn't message first). Create a simple template with
   two body variables, e.g.:
   > `{{1}}: {{2}}`
   in Meta Business Manager and wait for approval (usually a few hours).
   Free-form text (`WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_MODE=text`) only works within 24h of
   the person messaging your business number first — fine for local
   testing against the Meta test number, not for production notifications.
3. Set these in `.env.local` (added, disabled by default):
   ```
   WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true
   WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=...
   WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
   WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_NAME=work_notification   # must match your approved template
   WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_LANG=en_US
   ```
4. Give employees a WhatsApp number: Super Admin sets it when creating an
   account, or via the message-bubble icon next to any employee in the
   Employees table. Each person can be individually opted out
   (`whatsappOptIn`) without removing their number.

Code lives in `lib/whatsapp.ts` (the Cloud API client) and is wired into
`services/notificationService.ts`.

- **Unread badge:** the sidebar's Messages nav item shows a small red
  count badge with your total unread messages across all conversations
  (polled every 15s via the same `useConversations` hook the Messages page
  uses) — visible on both desktop and mobile nav.

## Notes on the tech choices

- **NextAuth v5 (`5.0.0-beta.31`)** is used because it's the version with
  a stable Next.js 16 peer-dependency range; v5 is still in beta upstream,
  so pin this version deliberately rather than floating to `@latest`.
- **`proxy.ts`** replaces the old `middleware.ts` file name, which Next
  16.2 deprecated in favor of `proxy.ts` (same API, same `config.matcher`).
- The build has been verified end-to-end with `npm run build` against this
  exact dependency set.
